# Defense-in-Depth: A case study on hardening Database Servers

## Introduction

An attacker has gained access to the internal network (post-breach). The objective is to determine what mechanisms prevent them from accessing, reading, modifying, or exfiltrating sensitive data from a PostgreSQL database system, and what mechanisms enable recovery when prevention fails.

This document defines the threat model for Project 5, which investigates post-breach database protection using defense-in-depth approaches. The threat analysis uses the STRIDE framework applied at each trust boundary in a PostgreSQL deployment. 

Hardening controls are derived from CIS PostgreSQL 17 Benchmark v1.0.0.

## Basline system

The baseline system is a PostgreSQL server deployed on a Linux machine that provides service through default port `5432` and persists data to an un-encryped file system (such as ext4) on a local disk. An attacher has already gained access to an internal server but haven't infiltrated to the machine hosting the PostgreSQL system.

            DB --read/write--> DISK
        end

        C --access--> DB

        AH("Attacker Host")
        
    end

```

## Key assets

What we need to protect inside the PostgreSQL system are:

1. Sensitive data in tables.
2. Credentials to gain access to the PostgreSQL.
3. Network traffic goes in and out of the PostgreSQL server.

## Trust boundaries

Identify where data crosses from one trust level to another. Those boundaries are the targets of the hacker to gain further access to the assets.

| ID | Boundary                  | Crosses from               | Crosses to                  |
| -- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| B1 | Network              | Untrusted network (breached)          | Database listener           |
| B2 | Authentication    | Anonymous connection       | Authenticated session       |
| B3 | Authorization  | Authenticated user         | Authorized data access      |
| B4 | Storage     | Filesystem / disk access   | Raw data files              |

## Threat enumeration 

This section lists threats by applying STRIDE at each trust boundaries.

### Threats at B1 Network boundary

## Mitigation strategy

This section proposes mitigations for the threats enumerated in Section 4. Mitigations are grouped by defense layer and reference specific threat IDs. Each mitigation is assigned a priority that determines implementation depth.


**Priority definitions:**

- **Demo** — Full attack-then-harden cycle with live demonstration
- **Config** — Implemented and verified, shown in configuration walkthrough
- **Acknowledge** — Documented as known limitation or residual risk

| T3.6          | Set statement_timeout per role                            | Acknowledge |

### Storage encryption layer (two-layer approach)

This layer uses two complementary encryption mechanisms. Each addresses a different attacker position; neither is sufficient alone.

**Layer A — Block-level encryption (LUKS / dm-crypt):**

Encrypts the entire PostgreSQL data directory at the filesystem level, including table files, pg_wal/, indexes, and configuration. Protects against offline access (stolen disk, cloud snapshot, decommissioned drive). Transparent to any process on the running host — does not protect against live shell access.

| Addresses     | Mitigation                                                | Priority    |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| T4.1          | Encrypt PG data directory with LUKS on a dedicated volume | Demo        |
| T4.3 (partial)| WAL files encrypted at rest on local disk via LUKS       | Demo        |
| T4.5          | Enable data checksums (initdb --data-checksums) to detect offline tampering | Config |

**Layer B — Column-level encryption (pgcrypto):**

Encrypts specific high-value columns within the database. Data remains encrypted in table files, in WAL segments, and in pg_dump output. Decryption requires the application-layer key, which is not stored in the database. Protects against live-shell attackers who can read files through the mounted filesystem, and against database users who bypass RBAC but lack the application key.

| Addresses     | Mitigation                                                | Priority    |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| T4.2          | Encrypt sensitive columns (SSN, credit card, etc.) with pgcrypto | Demo  |
| T4.4          | pgcrypto values remain encrypted even when read via pg_read_file or strings on data files | Demo |
| T4.6          | Revoke pg_read_server_files, pg_execute_server_program from application roles | Config |

**Planned escalation demo for storage encryption:**

The demonstration will show three attacker positions against the same data:

1. Offline attacker reads raw disk image → LUKS blocks all access
2. Live-shell attacker reads data files on mounted filesystem → non-pgcrypto columns are readable in plaintext; pgcrypto columns appear as binary noise
3. Authenticated attacker queries the database → RBAC/RLS controls access; pgcrypto columns return encrypted bytea without the application key

This three-step escalation demonstrates why both layers are necessary and why neither replaces the other.

### Backup and recovery 

Default PostgreSQL ships with archive_mode = off and no archive_command. WAL segments are recycled once no longer needed for crash recovery. This means a destructive event, such as ransomware, malicious DROP TABLE, or total host loss, is irrecoverable beyond the most recent pg_dump, if one exists. Enabling continuous WAL archiving with periodic base backups is itself a security mitigation: it provides point-in-time recovery to the moment before an incident.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph server
        PG("PostgreSQL")
        LOG@{ shape: cyl, label: "Log Storage 
        (pag_wal/)"}
        PG --wirte--> LOG
        WALG --read--> LOG
        WALG("WAL-G")
    end

    BS@{ shape: cyl, label: "Block Storage"}

    WALG --S3-->BS

    BS --manual recover--> PG
```

However, enabling archiving introduces new attack surface: WAL archives contain a full record of all data changes and must be protected in transit and at rest. The mitigations below address both the recovery gap and the security of the archiving pipeline.


## Known gaps and residual risks

### Key protection for runtime secrets

The fundamental challenge of any encryption-based defense is that the decryption key must be accessible to the process that uses it. Two keys in this project face this problem:

**Client certificate private keys (T2.5).** 
The client's private key must be readable by the psql or application process at connection time. If stored as a file on disk, any attacker who compromises the client host can copy the key and impersonate the user from any location. Available mitigations form a spectrum of increasing strength:

| Approach                     | Protects against                       | Does not protect against              |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| File permissions (chmod 600) | Other non-root users on same host      | Root compromise, postgres user compromise |
| Passphrase-protected key     | File copy (attacker needs passphrase)  | Live shell with keylogger or memory access |
| Hardware token (PKCS#11)     | Key extraction (key never leaves device) | Session hijacking while token is plugged in |
| Short-lived certs (Vault PKI, SPIFFE) | Long-term key theft (cert expires in minutes/hours) | Compromise during the cert's short lifetime |
